# realtimefilediff

Debugging permits you to view your pc memory and see what changed. But what if you need to debug files and see what changed from second to second? This tool could be useful if you want to inspect files while viewing the bytes in hex.
```
realtimefilediff.exe <file>
```
You get it from the releases tab.
